This is my model interpretation of a model toy car of a 1980 Lancia Delta. My goal for this project was to make my toy car have functional lights by using a raspberry pi zero to program them to do commands such as turn them on or off, or stay on for a certain time period. I have been able to successfully connect the led lights to my raspberry pi as well as my batteries with no prior knowledge, as well as being able to code this specific type of code. A challenge that i faced was that i wasn't able to finish it on time due to the fact that I had some issues with exporting the code onto a hard drive and then to the raspberry pi itself. My AI partner in this unit was ChatGPT4000. I used it for guidance on how to construct a step by step tutorial as well as helping me with writing the code.

Challenges include getting the AI to follow instructions precisely as intended, while still accommodating errors. Despite that, the collaboration with AI was, in fact, so effective that I was able to complete the plan statement I had stated before and successfully fulfill the requirements.
