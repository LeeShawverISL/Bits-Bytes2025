Shape guessing game 
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1128531344/

Brief Game Description:
The purpose of the game is for people to learn shapes and improve their knowledge in shape understanding. At first players will have to guess the exact shape from all of the other ones, then they move on to the next level, afterwards they will answer questions like: What shape is this? And then they would have to find one shape from all of the others, like the first task, but a bit challenging. One success is that I like how the game is looking so far, like the levels, questions and so on. One challenge was to save my game all the time, and also I was challenged with choosing the correct code.

UFO Destroyer

Brief Game Description:
My learning objective is to make a fun and creative game that educates children about shapes and addition. The Player’s objective is to get as much points before they loose all 3 lives. You can get points by shooting down the UFOs. If you shoot down the UFO that the game tells you to shoot, you get 10 points and a math question. If you get the math question correct, you get an additional 10 points and if you dont get it right you get no additional points. The one things that was successful was that I made a working game but one challenge was that I had hard time understanding the blocks and codes because this was the first time I had made a scratch game.

Brief Game Description:
The learning objective is for 2nd graders to learn about the knowledge of shapes. The player’s goal in the game is to catch 100  falling shapes and answer questions correctly. One success throughout the process of coding was making the questions for the 2nd graders to answer, either correctly or incorrectly. And one challenge that we had was making the shapes fall at the right speed, so you can catch the shapes on time.

Brief Game Description:

We are trying to teach the 4th graders about multiplication, division and fractions because that's what they are learning in 4th grade and what we learned. The objective of the game is to start on your journey as a knight saving a kingdom from a strong boss, on the way you will encounter many mini-bosses and engage in math combat until eventually, you defeat the boss. A success that we had was being able to make an above average scratch game having no knowledge. A challenge we had was collaborating and splitting our work evenly.

Witch game

Brief Game Description:
Our goal for the player is to play a fun and interesting game, but still learn math from it. The topic for learning that we choose is math, specifically multiplying,dividing, adding, and subtracting. One success that we have in the game is that the art of our game is really beautiful and kids will be interested because the colors are bright and outstanding and the art is really magical. One challenge that we had in the start is to start writing a code and just even understand the code for the game. But then we solved this challenge by searching for help through chat gpt, we gave him a description of what action we need in our game and then he gave us a code, and if we didn’t love we could make it better ourselves.
