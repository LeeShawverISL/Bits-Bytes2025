Website Description: Bits & Bytes
Overview:
The "Bits & Bytes" website is a professional, user-friendly platform designed to showcase projects and information related to a team or organization focused on technology, likely in the fields of computing, programming, or engineering. The website features a clean, minimalistic design with a consistent blue and white color scheme and a structured layout to enhance navigation and user experience. It is divided into multiple sections, including a Home page, a Projects page, and subpages for specific project groups (G4, G5, G8, G9, and G10). The website appears to target users interested in exploring team projects, learning about the team, and accessing multimedia content like videos and images as of March 5, 2025.

1. Home Page
Layout and Design:

The Home page is structured with a header and main content area, separated by a vertical line on the left side.
Header:
At the top, there is a dark blue banner featuring the "Bits & Bytes" logo (a stylized circuit board icon with the text "Bits & Bytes") on the left side, serving as the brand identifier.
To the right of the logo, there is a navigation button labeled "About the team," styled as a rounded blue button with white text. This button links to a page providing information about the team behind Bits & Bytes.
Main Content:
The main content area is divided into two sections: a left sidebar and a right content panel.
Left Sidebar (List of Projects):
Titled "List of projects," this section lists project groups in blue text: G4 projects, G5 projects, G8 projects, G9 projects, and G10 projects. These are likely categories or teams of projects, and clicking on any of these links navigates to a specific projects page (e.g., G4, G5, G8, G9, or G10 projects page).
Right Content Panel:
The initial view (first 2-3 slides) displays a welcome message in large, bold black text: "Welcome to the Bits & Bytes event." This suggests the website may be part of an event or showcase related to Bits & Bytes activities.
A downward arrow (▼) indicates that users need to scroll down to access additional information (4-5 slides), implying more content is available below the fold.
Upon scrolling, the page reveals additional elements, such as:
The "Bits & Bytes" logo, which acts as a home button, allowing users to return to the top of the page or the main homepage.
Links to webpages with project details, providing deeper access to project information.
A link to a page about the people who made the project, offering transparency and credit to the team members.
Functionality:

The "About the team" button in the header provides a direct link to a separate page with team information.
The project list in the sidebar serves as a navigation menu, enabling users to explore specific project groups (G4, G5, G8, G9, G10).
Scrolling is required to uncover all content, enhancing user engagement and encouraging exploration.
The logo functions as a home button, improving navigation usability.
2. Projects Page (General Structure for G4, G5, G8, G9, G10)
Layout and Design:

The Projects page is accessed by selecting any project group from the Home page sidebar (e.g., "G4 projects," "G5 projects," etc.).
Header:
Similar to the Home page, the header includes the "Bits & Bytes" logo on the left and a navigation button labeled "Back to main screen" on the right, styled as a blue button with white text. This button allows users to return to the Home page.
Main Content:
The main content area is divided into a left sidebar and a right content panel, consistent with the Home page layout.
Left Sidebar (List of Projects):
Titled "List of projects," this section lists the same project groups as on the Home page: G4 projects, G5 projects, G8 projects, G9 projects, and G10 projects, all in blue text. When a user clicks on one of these (e.g., G4, G5, G8, G9, or G10 projects), it highlights the selected item, indicating the active page.
Right Content Panel:
For each project group (G4, G5, G8, G9, G10), the content is displayed in a card or grid format rather than a traditional table, as noted in the wireframe annotations. This design choice makes the webpage lighter and more visually appealing.
Each project is represented by a two-column layout:
Left Column (Preview and Link): Contains a "Preview and a link" section, likely a thumbnail or image of the project with a clickable link to more detailed information or the project itself.
Right Column (Description of the Project): Provides a brief description of the project, offering context and details.
The page includes multiple project entries, each with a preview and description, arranged horizontally. The specific projects and students vary by group (e.g., Students #1, #2, #3, #5 for G4, but potentially different students or projects for G5, G8, G9, G10).
Direct links to the works are provided in the sidebar or project cards, allowing users to bypass descriptions and access the projects immediately if desired.
Functionality:

Clicking a project group in the sidebar highlights the selection, improving navigation clarity.
The card-based layout enhances user interest and reduces page load by avoiding heavy table structures.
Direct links to works cater to users who prefer quick access to project content without reading descriptions.
The "Back to main screen" button facilitates easy navigation back to the Home page.
3. Specific Subpages for G4, G5, G8, G9, and G10 Projects
Layout and Design (Common Elements Across All Groups):

Each subpage (G4, G5, G8, G9, G10) is accessed by clicking the corresponding project group from the Home or Projects page.
Header:
Features the "Bits & Bytes" logo on the left and a "Back to main screen" button on the right, consistent with other pages.
Main Content:
The layout mirrors the Projects page but focuses specifically on the selected project group (e.g., G4, G5, G8, G9, or G10).
Left Sidebar (List of Projects):
Lists all project groups (G4, G5, G8, G9, G10), with the selected group (e.g., G4 projects) highlighted to indicate the current page.
Right Content Panel:
Displays a horizontal layout of project cards, each containing:
A "Preview and a link" (likely an image or thumbnail with a hyperlink to the project).
A "Description of the project" providing details about the work.
The page includes a navigation bar at the top with buttons for G4, G5, G8, G9, and G10 projects, allowing quick switching between project groups.
